# Exploratory Data Analysis using Python 
I performed EDA on the WHO dataset that is about the death rates of under 5 age group children globally. You can find the raw data & official analysis here https://platform.who.int/data/maternal-newborn-child-adolescent-ageing/indicator-explorer-new/mca/number-of-under-five-deaths---by-cause. Attached is the Juypter Notebook for reference.
